HVIDEO description
 Data description
HVIDEO is a smart TV dataset that contains 260k users watching logs from October 1st 2016 
to June 30th 2017. The logs are collected on two platforms (the V-domain and the E-domain) 
from a well-known smart TV service provider.
The V-domain contains family video watching behavior including TV series, movies, cartoons, 
talent shows and other programs. And the E-domain covers online educational videos based 
on textbooks from elementary to high school, as well as instructional videos on sports, food, 
medical, etc. 
On the two platforms, we gather user behaviors, including which video is played, when a 
smart TV starts to play a video, and when it stops playing the video, and how long the video
has been watched.

 Data statistics
We craw 13,714 overlapped user, which includes 16,407 items, 227,390 logs of V-domain and 
3,380 items, 177,758 logs of E-domain.
We randomly divide the data sets into training set(75%), test set(10%), valid set(15%)
